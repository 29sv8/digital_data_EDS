# digital_data_EDS
 Repository for code snippets, modules and programs for (geospatial) data analysis.

This repository was created by Sanne Vreugdenhil on 27-03-2024 with the purpose of storing code snippets, modules and 
programs that were written for the processing and analysis of (geospatial) data within the NIOZ EDS department. 

Python code is added to this repository for people to use in their (geospatial) analysis. It will be added in the form of
modules containing several functions related to a certain purpose, Jupyter notebooks for entire analysis, or Jupyter
notebooks to use in (parts of) your analysis. 

Disclaimer: code in this repository is always under development, and it may be that certain pieces of code will not 
work properly for your specific analysis. 

If you have any problems with the code, questions, or remarks please contact me via sanne.vreugdenhil@nioz.nl.
